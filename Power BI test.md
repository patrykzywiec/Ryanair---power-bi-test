Imagine you need to create a one-page report for the CFO. We are testing new products, and we want to see some important information about them.

Here are the requirements:

1. **Revenue Metric**: Calculate revenue based on price, units sold, and discounts.
2. **Transaction Count**: Show the total number of transactions (each row in the Sales table represents one transaction).
3. **Product Matrix**: Create a matrix that displays product categories and their products. This matrix should show revenue and the percentage of each product's revenue within its category.
4. **Top 5 Countries**: List the top 5 countries by revenue.
5. **Country Interaction**: When you hover over a country, it should display revenue by last name. Right-clicking should allow you to drill down to a details page showing email, last name, revenue, and transaction date.
6. **Date Plot**: Create a plot with a date axis that shows two measures: the number of transactions on the transaction date and the number of transactions by the departure date.
7. **Useful Filters**: Include any filters you think would be helpful.

Use your skills in modeling and report design to complete this task. If you're unsure how to do something, feel free to suggest an alternative.
